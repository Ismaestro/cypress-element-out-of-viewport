## Usage

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.4.
To see this in action, just start it, with:
```typescript
npm start
```

Then run cypress with
```typescript
npm run cypress:run
```

And you will see the error because of one element out of the viewport. :)

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via cypress.
